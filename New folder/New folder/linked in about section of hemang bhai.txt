ðŸ‘‹ Hello There! I'm Hemang, a passionate Software Engineer with about 2.5+ years of experience contributing to the dynamic team at Sprinklr. With a knack for building robust solutions from scratch, I've led successful ui migrations, optimized application performance, and engineered essential infrastructure components to enhance overall efficiency.

My journey in software development has been marked by a passion for exploration and continuous learning. At Sprinklr, I've mastered ReactJS, NextJS, TypeScript, and GraphQL, delivering impactful projects and driving innovation within the organization. Outside of my professional responsibilities, I explore technologies like Java, GoLang, SpringBoot, PostgreSQL, Docker, and AWS through personal projects. This not only broadens my skill set but also fuels my creativity and problem-solving abilities.

I'm a proud graduate of DAIICT, where I earned my (Honours) degree in ICT with a minor in Computational Science. My academic journey, coupled with a CGPA of 8.57/10, reflects my commitment to excellence and continuous growth.

I'm driven by a relentless pursuit of excellence and thrive in collaborative environments where innovation and learning is encouraged. 

Let's connect to explore opportunities.
